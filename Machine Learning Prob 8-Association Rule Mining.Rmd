#Graphs for first set of rules

These graphs are for visualizing as much of the data as possible, and then based of these graphs we pick a subset of the data to look at

```{r graphs, echo=FALSE}

# Create a scatter plot with the x-axis starting at 0.1
plot(grocery_rules, method = "scatterplot", measure = "support", shading = "lift", xlim = c(0, 0.1))


# Plotting support vs. confidence, with color representing lift
plot(grocery_rules, method = "scatterplot", measure = c("support", "lift"), shading = "confidence", xlim = c(0, 0.1))



```
#Look at subsets based off graphs above

```{r using graphs lets look at some subsets, eval=FALSE}

inspect(subset(grocery_rules, support > 0.05)) # 34 rules

inspect(subset(grocery_rules, support > 0.01)) #610 rules

inspect(subset(grocery_rules, confidence > 0.75)) #458

```

## Most relevant subset:
```{r Most relevant subset}

inspect(subset(grocery_rules, lift > 10)) #78 rules

```

##Support 0.05% and above

Things to understand:

A big difference between this data set and the playlist data set is how frequently items appear. In this data set, the support at 0.05% only draws 34 rules (appears in 5% of baskets or more). Of these rules, 28 of them are just an item by itself! This gives us insight into the grocery shopping of individuals, and suggests people have very different grocery shopping lists. Besides these 28 items, there is a lot of diversity in what people buy. 

These 28 items included: canned beef, coffee, beef, napkins, pork, newspapers, domestic eggs, butter, fruit/vegetable juice, pastry, bottled water, soda, yogurt, rolls/buns, other vegetables, milk, etc. 

These are very common food items, so it makes sense that they appear constantly throughout the data. Milk has the highest support of 25%, which makes sense as our graph earlier had milk as the most common food item.

The other rules included: 

yogurt --> whole milk 

other vegetables --> whole milk

rolls/buns --> whole milk

and the opposites of these as well! Notice that these are the top 3 items that appeared across all baskets, and their lifts stay between 1.2 to 1.5. This suggests that these associations are not at all powerful, and their appearence here is more than likely because they appear throughout all baskets, not because they have associations with each other. 

The difference between the the grocery data and playlist data is why in the first graph above, I choose a support of 0.001 and confidence of 0.01. I wanted to capture many rules (graph captured 39,000 rules!), so I could find interesting patterns and then look at the subsets. 

##Confidence 75% and above

when looking at confidence of 75% and above, we find there are 458 rules. This is interesting, as it represents the probability of the right hand side showing up based on what is in the left hand side. However, we may run into an issue. If something is very common like milk, there is a chance that most products will have a high confidence when milk is on the right side! This doesn't necessarily indicate a strong association! 

Therefore, when looking for rules it is better to just look at the lift (which tells us how much *more likely* an item is to be bought if it appears with another, and accounts for frequency of the right hand side)

However, some of the 458 rules with conf above 75% include:

Citrus fruit, fruit/vegetable juice, grapes --> tropical fruit (lift of 8!)

frozen meals, tropical fruit, yogurt --> whole milk (lift of 3)

When looking through the 75% confidence rules, my hypothesis came out true! As I scrolled down, the majority of the right hand side was milk! and the lift was around 3 on average for those which contained milk, suggesting that these rules weren't very meaningful. I included above one rule which had a lift of 8 (suggesting it is genuinely strong!) and one rule with on the right hand side milk and a lift of 3. Notice that for the first rule, the foods make sense to be bought together. Clearly, the person is buying things to make something fruity! However, for the milk rule, notice that frozen meals, tropical fruit, yogurt, and then milk, don't really create an intresting meaningful rule. Rather, it seems to be a conglomerate of random things. 

##Lift of 10+

When looking at a lift above 10 (i.e., if item on left hand side appears, the item on the right hand side is 10 times as likely to appear), we find 78 rules. I decided on the number ten based on insights from the graph, and when we look at these 78 rules together, we find foods/items that tend to go together! For example: 

softener --> detergent (lift: 10)

popcorn, soda --> salty snack (16)

ham, bread --> cheese (lift: 22)

bottled beer, red/blush wine --> liquor (35)

and much more!

These rules make *way* more sense than just looking at the confidence. It has found associations between cleaning products, alcohol, popcorn, and sandwich purchases that make perfect sense and by intuition are quite common! 

Something else I noticed is that quite a few of the rules are 2-3 items together and the inclusion of a 4th. A lot of times this 4th item doesn't have as close of an association with the other items, BUT it is considered a necessity, such:

Butter, root vegetables, and whole milk --> rice

I personally do not necessarily see a connection with these foods, however they are considered essential household foods. Perhaps, when we get rules like these, it suggests that when people buy a lot of food, they tend to buy many necesities, etc. 

#First Igraph code
(Turned out pretty ugly)

```{r Prepare for igraph, eval=FALSE}

# Convert grocery_rules to Graph and Export for Gephi
grocery_graph <- associations2igraph(grocery_rules, associationsAsNodes = FALSE)
igraph::write_graph(grocery_graph, file='grocery_rules.graphml', format = "graphml")

```

```{r, first igraph, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/cardo/OneDrive/Documents/R/Intro Machine Learning/ML part 2/First_Igraph_(ML prob 8).png")

```

Above, we see an igraph based on the first settings, which were very broad. Turned out very ugly, not much can be done with it. 

#Second Rules based on previous graphs

support: 0.001
confidence: 0.01
max length: 4

**lift:** 6

```{r visualizing relationships2, echo=TRUE, fig.show="hide"}

# Step 6: Association Rule Mining
f_grocery_rules <- apriori(grocery_transactions, 
                 parameter = list(supp = 0.001, conf = .01, maxlen=4))

f_grocery_rules <- subset(f_grocery_rules, lift > 6)


```
#Second rules graphs

```{r graphs2, echo=FALSE}
# Create a scatter plot with the x-axis starting at 0.1
plot(f_grocery_rules, method = "scatterplot", measure = "support", shading = "lift", xlim = c(0, 0.1))


# Plotting support vs. confidence, with color representing lift
plot(f_grocery_rules, method = "scatterplot", measure = c("support", "lift"), shading = "confidence", xlim = c(0, 0.1))
```

Based off of previous subsets and the analysis, these above are the graphs of our final rules for lift, support, and confidence. 


#Second and Final Igraph

```{r visualizing relationships3, eval=FALSE}

# Step 7: Convert to Graph and Export for Gephi
f_grocery_graph <- associations2igraph(f_grocery_rules, associationsAsNodes = FALSE)
igraph::write_graph(f_grocery_graph, file='f_grocery_rules.graphml', format = "graphml")

```

Here is the network graph generated using Gephi:

```{r include-gephi-graph-png, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/cardo/OneDrive/Documents/R/Intro Machine Learning/ML part 2/Prob8_Gephi_Graph_Final.png")

```

By using the Gephi tutorial within the professor's github, we get this result. Gephi discovered 6 communities within the data! Gephi also got their share of all the data:

Purple: 27%
Green: 25%
Blue: 25%
Orange: 12.64%
Dark Green: 6.9%
Pink: 2.3%

The graph is an association network, so in short terms it represents items that are bought together. They may indicate common ingredients, styles of food, necessities, etc. Something which worried me at first, was how small the whole milk node is. it is in the purple group, below the butter. I was concerned, as it was the most frequent item but was small in the results. However, I believe this is due to what was discussed earlier: frequency **does not ** necessarily indicate strong association. 

**Individual Nodes**

Look at the large nodes, like root vegetables, butter, white break, tropical fruit, etc. These are nodes that have lots of strong associations for many other products. As the nodes get smaller and further away, these have less associations and the associations are weaker. 

Root vegetables for example, are bought often with oil, citrus fruit, fruit/vegetable juice, herbs, rice, other vegetables, etc. This can be determined by looking at the arrows and which directions they point in (although it is a little tough to do)

Another node or community we can look at, is sugar. Based off of the arrows, we can determine that flour, baking powder, margarine, domestic eggs, salt, and roll products have strong associations with sugar and with each other (whenever their arrows point at each other). However, something like roll products and salt, although they are in the same community, don't have an association. 

**Communities**

We have already covered two communities, green (root vegetables) and dark green (sugar). The items within each group do seem to corespond to each other, and the identity of these communities makes sense. 

The orange community also seems to make sense. Whipped/sour cream, yogurt, curd, cream cheese, sliced cheese do make a lot of sense together and are relatable! On the outskirts, we see smaller associations which do still make sense, just not as much and only with specific other items. For example, deserts, cereal, meat spread, coffee, etc. Notice how these only have a couple arrows pointing at them. Coffee only has one! What this has taught me is that the further away/smaller a point is from the middle of the group, the less relatable and less often it is bought with those things

The community which makes the most sense and is especially specific is pink, which only contains softner and detergent. The lift was 10, and the confidence was 90%, so them being together and their own category makes sense

Two communities I found to be broad were the purple and blue communities. Some things don't necessarily make sense to be a part of the same community. For example, in purple, napkins, butter, hamburgers, and chocolate are all in the same group! In order to understand it better, you must take a look at where the arrows are going and which arrow is touching which. If you look closely, napkins and hamburgers do **NOT** have a lie drawn towards each other, even though they are particularly large nodes in the same community. Rather, they connect with nodes within the same community, and have sort of their own subsets of associations. For example, hamburgers has sauces and instant food products nearby, with suaces only connected to hamburgers. 

You can also find another sub community in purple, cat food and pet care products. 

The blue community also has a lot of sub communities, for example: 

Popcorn, salty snacks, soda
Bread, processed cheese, ham
Bottled beer, liquor, red/blush wine

My personal favorite, there are connections between soda and liquor! Could this be jack and coke?

In the future, I would love to dive further and understand why the blue and purple communities have strange associations. I would also like to perhaps include even more communities!
